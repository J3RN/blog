<p>The original reason was social engineering lite. Occasionally I would have to dress up for events in high school, and I noticed that when I did people treated me differently. There&rsquo;s a ton of research into subconscious biases that&rsquo;s honestly really fascinating, but suffice it to say that police officers are usually nicer to well-dressed people that they pull over.</p><p><strong>Doesn&rsquo;t telling us this negate the effect?</strong> Probably a bit.</p><p>There is a flip side: I had to dress down a little bit when I lived in Portland because folks there weren&rsquo;t really keen on suit-and-tie types. Fun Factâ„¢.</p></li><li>
<p>Closely related, but I&rsquo;m (almost) never underdressed. I tend to forget events (like interviews) but have never had to run home and change.</p></li><li>
<p>Remove unnecessary decision-making. I hate having to make trivial decisions, and I consider choosing an outfit one of those. I carry a quarter in my wallet for most other ones.</p></li></ol><h3 id=what-about class="relative group">&ldquo;What about&mldr; <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#what-about aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h3><ul>
