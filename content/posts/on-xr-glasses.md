I've had a persistent problem that's needed addressing for several years now: I like working on my patio.  There are so many redeeming aspects to working outside, from the warm breeze and fresh air to visits from the local wildlife, but it has its share of drawbacks, too.  For one, it's awfully bright outside.  I work under a large umbrella to keep myself (and my screen) shielded from the sun.  That helps, and it has been important to me to choose a laptop with a bright screen (400+ nits).  Also switching to light mode during daylight hours has helped with this as well.  But there's one problem that has persisted: screen size.

My desk in my office hosts a beautiful 38" LG monitor that I adore.
