When I first looked at OpenSCAD, the programming language, I assumed that it would be my enemy.  I assumed that this C-style syntax was indicative of the language's imperative design; that building models in OpenSCAD would consist of a sequence of instructions of exactly how one might put the model together; like 3D printer G-code.

Happily, I was wrong.
