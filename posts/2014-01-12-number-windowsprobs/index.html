<h2 id=linux-is-great>Linux is Great <a href=#linux-is-great class=anchor>üîó</a></h2><p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve used Windows - probably a few years. It&rsquo;s been
even longer since I legitimately cared about fixing Windows problems and didn&rsquo;t
instead opt for wiping the partition and doing a fresh reinstall.</p>
<h2 id=trust-me-im-a-developer>Trust me, I&rsquo;m a Developer <a href=#trust-me-im-a-developer class=anchor>üîó</a></h2><p>As a computer scientist, naturally I run into people who confuse &ldquo;developer&rdquo;
with &ldquo;IT Professional&rdquo; and ask me to fix their computers for them. My general
catch-all for this is &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fix Windows problems.&rdquo; In the case they use a
Mac, I expect macOS to lock them out of doing most harmful things to their
system. If they happen to be a Linux user (which, to date, none have been), I
would happily hack on their machine until it has recovered some amount of
usability. But more often than not, it&rsquo;s Windows. And I don&rsquo;t fix Windows
problems.</p>
<h2 id=the-j3rn-way>The J3RN Way‚Ñ¢ <a href=#the-j3rn-way class=anchor>üîó</a></h2><p>Today it was discovered that if you pester me long enough, you might
just get me to at least give it a go. An HP 8570w Workstation Laptop. A
powerhouse, on paper. A monstrous thing with a boot loop issue.</p>
<p>Alright, let&rsquo;s do this The J3RN Way‚Ñ¢. I&rsquo;ll save your important documents,
but we&rsquo;re going to wipe the system and reinstall.</p>
<p>I need to boot from disk or USB and can&rsquo;t. F10 to get to BIOS settings. Well,
they don&rsquo;t do jack shit unless you disable SecureBoot (according to a forum
post) and enable Legacy mode (which I can confirm actually does things).</p>
<p>Alright, we can boot from USB. Let&rsquo;s boot to a Manjaro Linux LiveCD so
I can move all these important files to my external hard drive affectionately
named &ldquo;DAISI.&rdquo; Leaping into the file manager (Thunar, I belive it is), quickly
mount all available drives.</p>
<h2 id=five-partitions-in-search-of-an-exit>Five Partitions in Search of an Exit <a href=#five-partitions-in-search-of-an-exit class=anchor>üîó</a></h2><p>Wait, all of these just have Linux top-level directories on them&mldr; Alright,
let&rsquo;s crack open some GParted - my favorite last-resort partition manager! It
complains about the partition table once, and again, and perhaps a third time.
Alright, we&rsquo;re in. /dev/sda appears to have about 5 partitions, mostly in NTFS.
Sounds like your general factory install of Windows. On /dev/sda? Weird.</p>
<p>Alright, /dev/sda4 is a big hunk of NTFS. I can only imagine this is where
the nice people at HP thought my buddy here would like to store his files.
Let&rsquo;s mount it. &ldquo;How about &lsquo;No!&rsquo;,&rdquo; screams mount, &ldquo;This is a RAID
0 volume, and I can&rsquo;t handle that shit!&rdquo; I like to paraphrase sometimes. Not
often. Well, I don&rsquo;t know much about RAID either, so I can&rsquo;t do much about
that.</p>
<p>So my friend says he has his Windows system recovery CD. Well, the built-in
feature tries to load for about five seconds, then just crashes out to a blue
screen with a &ldquo;:(&rdquo;, then reboots immediately, so it may be worth a try. Good
work on the sad face, Microsoft. Classy. I liked it. Now all you need is to
make your system less easy to utterly destroy, and we might be friends.</p>
<p>Booting with the disk, a whole lot of nothing happens. Jumping back into the
BIOS settings, I search for anything that could be blocking the ability to boot
from disk. Not being able to find anything about it is hardly conclusive - who
knew you needed to enable Legacy mode to boot from a USB drive?</p>
<p>Anyway, I pop out the disk and have a look at it. It is entitled &ldquo;Applications
and Drivers&rdquo; and additionally says &ldquo;This software comes preinstalled.&rdquo; This
disk isn&rsquo;t Windows recovery - it&rsquo;s a disk full of manufacturer bloatware, most
likely. Thanks, HP. That was real useful.</p>
<h2 id=the-os-of-our-discontent>The OS of Our Discontent <a href=#the-os-of-our-discontent class=anchor>üîó</a></h2><p>I sit back in my chair and look at this dysfunctional heap of hardware. I tried
to save some files, and couldn&rsquo;t. I tried to reinstall and couldn&rsquo;t. This
machine was at an intersection of evils: No protection against the end-user
destroying the system, and no way to service the system once it was broken.</p>
<p>So thus I have been brought to my knees. I beg of you, HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus,
and other PC hardware manufacturers - Just ship Linux! A new machine with an
LTS version of Ubuntu pre-installed would simply be a dream.</p>
<p>Oh, and fix your disgusting UEFI interface. It sucks.</p>
