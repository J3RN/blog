This update consists primarily of developer quality-of-life improvements. In his announcement, JosÃ© elaborated on a few changes, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but feel that some exciting changes were relegated to footnotes. As such, I&amp;rsquo;m dedicating this post to trawling through the full changelog and shining a spotlight on a few of my favorite changes.</description></item><item><title>The Harmful Duality of Elixir's nil</title><link>http://j3rn.com/posts/2020-12-13-harmful-duality-of-elixirs-nil/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2020 20:46:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://j3rn.com/posts/2020-12-13-harmful-duality-of-elixirs-nil/</guid><description>The Problem ðŸ”—Have you ever written code like this?
def get_address(address_id) do case Addresses.get(address_id) do nil -&amp;gt; {:error, :address_not_found} val -&amp;gt; {:ok, val} end end I have. This pattern is commonly used to make the value that Ecto.Repo.get/3 returns (a struct or nil) play well with Elixir&amp;rsquo;s with construct. Since Ecto.Repo.get/3 will always return some single value, a nil check is required to determine whether that value indicates a success or a failure.</description></item></channel></rss>
