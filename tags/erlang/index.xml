Let It Crash #And your first reaction to this is probably astonishment, because crashing is, generally-speaking, not ideal. In traditional, single-threaded systems, a crash means that your program dies and—in server settings—it&amp;rsquo;s then the responsibility of some other service (SystemD or Kubernetes or whatever) to notice that your program has died and restart it. In the event that this process was non-redundant (which is, itself, bad), this may result in downtime.</description></item><item><title>Debugging Elixir with Erlang's dbg</title><link>http://j3rn.com/posts/debugging-with-dbg/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://j3rn.com/posts/debugging-with-dbg/</guid><description>Sometimes, either in local development or on a production server, you want to see when a given function is called, what arguments it is being called with, and what it&amp;rsquo;s returning. Let&amp;rsquo;s say that you have a MyApp.Widgets.show_widget?/1 function which consumes a widget and returns a boolean indicating whether or not that widget should be shown to the user. However, the logic contained in there is pretty complicated and—worse—you don&amp;rsquo;t know really where it is called from anyway.</description></item></channel></rss>
