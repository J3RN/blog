When I did, I found so much of the terminology confusing; things had overlapping names and nothing seemed consistent. This table hopefully helps you (and me!) keep it all straight.&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;th>Name&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Description&lt;/th>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>.NET&lt;/td>
&lt;td>
The "application platform" for all other technologies listed here. It consists of:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Common Language Runtime (or CLR)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Libraries (standard lib type stuff; i/o, dates and times, etc)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Compiler&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SDK and tools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>"App stacks" such as ASP.NET Core and Windows Forms&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>.NET Framework&lt;/td>
&lt;td>A closed-source, Windows-only version of .NET that is deprecated. It's last version is .NET Framework 4.8.1, released in 2022.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>.NET Core&lt;/td>
&lt;td>A newer implementation of .NET that is &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet">open source&lt;/a> and cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS). Since .NET Framework is deprecated, it is commonly referred to as just ".NET".&lt;br>&lt;br>The latest version as of writing is .NET Core 8.0.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>ASP.NET&lt;/td>
&lt;td>ASP.NET is a web framework extending .NET for making web services. The term can refer to the original ASP.NET, the closed-source, .NET Framework version which, naturally, is also deprecated, or ASP.NET Core, the newer, open-source version targeting .NET Core.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>ASP.NET Core&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The newer, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore">open-source&lt;/a>, cross-platform web framework.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Entity Framework&lt;/td>
&lt;td>An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for .NET. The story with Entity Framework is very similar to the story with ASP.NET; it was originally shipped as part of .NET Framework, but has been split off and has been superseded by Entity Framework Core.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Entity Framework Core&lt;/td>
&lt;td>The newer, &lt;a href="https://github.com/dotnet/efcore">open-source&lt;/a>, cross-platform ORM.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll add more terms as I encounter them!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
