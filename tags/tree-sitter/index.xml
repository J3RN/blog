This post discusses a tool that displays code within colored boxes. The current implementation provides titles on the boxes which might be of use to those without (color) vision, but I have not verified it with a screen reader. I will strive in my future work to create tools that are of use to the (color)blind community.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
