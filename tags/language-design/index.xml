Don&amp;rsquo;t become attached to any IDE, text editor, programming language, or operating system. This field is young and constantly evolving; you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be left behind.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I realized at that time what tremendously insightful advice this was. At that time I was primarily writing Java in Eclipse. Over the next few years I would work professionally in PHP and Ruby and then later migrate to Elixir.</description></item></channel></rss>
